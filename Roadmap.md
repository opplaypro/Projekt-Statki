# Project Roadmap: Multiplayer Board Game

## Phase 1: Initial Setup
1. **Define Game Rules**
    - Each player has their own 10x10 board.
    - There is one shared common board for all players.
    - Players take turns to shoot at other players' boards.
    - After X rounds, the common board becomes targetable.

2. **Create Game Board** **&rarr; completed**
    - Implement a 10x10 grid for individual player boards.
    - Implement a 10x10 grid for the common board.

3. **Player Management**
    - Create a system to manage multiple players.
    - Assign each player their own board.

## Phase 2: Game Mechanics
1. **Turn-Based System**
    - Implement a turn-based system for players to take turns.
    - Allow players to select a target cell on another player's board.

2. **Shooting Mechanism**
    - Implement logic to handle shooting at a target cell.
    - Mark hits and misses on the boards.

3. **Common Board Activation**
    - Track the number of rounds played.
    - After X rounds, unlock the common board for targeting.

## Phase 3: Game Logic
1. **Win/Loss Conditions**
    - Define conditions for winning (e.g., eliminate all opponents).
    - Handle scenarios where multiple players remain.

2. **Scoring System**
    - Optionally, implement a scoring system based on hits/misses.

## Phase 4: User Interface
1. **Board Display**
    - Create a visual representation of the boards.
    - Show individual boards and the common board.

2. **Player Interaction**
    - Allow players to select target cells via the UI.
    - Display feedback for hits, misses, and board updates.

## Phase 5: Multiplayer Support
1. **Local Multiplayer**
    - Implement support for multiple players on the same device.

2. **Online Multiplayer (Optional)**
    - Add networking capabilities for remote players.

## Phase 6: Testing and Balancing
1. **Game Testing**
    - Test the game mechanics for bugs and edge cases.
    - Ensure the game is balanced and fun to play.

2. **Adjustments**
    - Adjust board size, number of rounds, or other parameters based on feedback.

## Phase 7: Deployment
1. **Packaging**
    - Package the game for distribution.
    - Ensure compatibility with target platforms.

2. **Release**
    - Publish the game and gather user feedback for future updates.






    ## Programming Roadmap: Step-by-Step Implementation

    ### Phase 1: Initial Setup
    1. **Define Game Rules**
        - Write a document or comments in the code to outline the game rules.
        - Create constants or configuration files to store game parameters (e.g., board size, number of rounds).

    2. **Create Game Board**
        - Write a function to generate a 10x10 grid for individual player boards.
        - Write a function to generate the shared common board.
        - Add logic to initialize these boards at the start of the game.

    3. **Player Management**
        - Create a `Player` class or data structure to manage player information (e.g., name, board, score).
        - Write a function to initialize multiple players and assign them boards.

    ### Phase 2: Game Mechanics
    1. **Turn-Based System**
        - Implement a loop to manage player turns.
        - Write a function to allow players to select a target cell on another player's board.

    2. **Shooting Mechanism**
        - Write a function to handle shooting logic (e.g., check if a cell is hit or missed).
        - Update the board to reflect hits and misses.

    3. **Common Board Activation**
        - Add a counter to track the number of rounds played.
        - Write logic to unlock the common board after the specified number of rounds.

    ### Phase 3: Game Logic
    1. **Win/Loss Conditions**
        - Write a function to check if a player has been eliminated.
        - Add logic to determine the winner when only one player remains.

    2. **Scoring System**
        - Optionally, implement a scoring system to track hits and misses for each player.

    ### Phase 4: User Interface
    1. **Board Display**
        - Write code to visually represent the boards (e.g., using ASCII art or a graphical library).
        - Display individual boards and the common board.

    2. **Player Interaction**
        - Implement input handling to allow players to select target cells.
        - Display feedback for hits, misses, and board updates.

    ### Phase 5: Multiplayer Support
    1. **Local Multiplayer**
        - Write logic to handle multiple players taking turns on the same device.

    2. **Online Multiplayer (Optional)**
        - Use a networking library or framework to enable remote player interactions.
        - Implement server-client communication for game state synchronization.

    ### Phase 6: Testing and Balancing
    1. **Game Testing**
        - Write unit tests for core game mechanics (e.g., shooting, turn management).
        - Test edge cases and unusual scenarios.

    2. **Adjustments**
        - Modify game parameters (e.g., board size, number of rounds) based on testing feedback.

    ### Phase 7: Deployment
    1. **Packaging**
        - Use a packaging tool to bundle the game for distribution.
        - Ensure compatibility with target platforms (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux).

    2. **Release**
        - Publish the game on a platform (e.g., itch.io, Steam).
        - Gather user feedback and plan for future updates.
